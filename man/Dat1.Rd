\description{
A sagittal slice from the fMRI time series for subject 0050048. The scan was
obtained at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. The scan has
been pre-processed with slice time correction, rigid body realignment
estimation, spatial normalization to MNI space, and linear detrending.
Subject 0050048 was a typically-developing 11-year-old male. The scan has
many artifacts. A mask was applied to vectorize the spatial
dimensions.
